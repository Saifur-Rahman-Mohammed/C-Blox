# C-Blox
A visual block-based programming language designed to bridge the gap between hardware and software through block-based serial/I2c communication.

Blocks can be built using the intuitive interface of the program, and connecting the C-shaped magnetic-like blocks in the order of your flowcode, with various data logging tools like graphics displays and console windows. This allows users to construct complex algorithms with only blocks, and control their hardware efficiently and robustly.
